These files don't run at runtime. Instead, they were used to manipulate our original datasheet into eventually a text file that we read to generate our adjacency list. These were originally all individual files with their own main. To maintain functionality, main on all of these files has been renamed. 

I've also included some of the .csv files used to generate the data along the way. Original .csv was provided by simplemaps.com

UTM.cpp and UTM.h are from an external library, and were not made by us.
